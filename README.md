# Weather App

This is a simple weather application that shows the current weather information for cities around the world. Users can search for a city and view real-time data such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.

The app fetches data from a weather API and presents it in a clean and user-friendly interface. It is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

You will need an API key from a weather service (like OpenWeatherMap) to use this app. Just add your API key in the code where required.

This project is ideal for learning how to work with APIs and display dynamic data in a web application.
